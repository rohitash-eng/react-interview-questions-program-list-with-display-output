# 🌐 React & JavaScript Interview Questions | Programs

Welcome to this repository! 🚀  

Here, I’ve compiled a collection of **JavaScript programs**, **Data Structure questions**, and **React interview concepts**.  
The goal of this repo is to provide **practical examples** with working outputs, making it easier to prepare for technical interviews.  

I have also created a **React component** that displays each question along with its output, so you can visualize the solution better.  
For a quick test, you can also copy-paste the code into any online JavaScript editor.
